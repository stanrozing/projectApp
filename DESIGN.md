# Design

The advanced sketches of my UI and a diagram of modules, classes and functions can be found in a separate file. 

## API's:

* Football-data.org http://api.football-data.org/documentation for getting info about competitions, teams and players
* https://apifootball.com/documentation/#Livescore possibly for getting information about fixtures and live scores

No other Data sources or Databases will be used. (At least not how it is planned now)
